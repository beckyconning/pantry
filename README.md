Pantry
======

Always up to date information storage and retrieval with Kefir and CouchDB.

## Features
`pantry.contents` and `pantry.put` are working experimentally. Please see `example.js` for an example.

## Testing
The tests are currently out of date and the next task is to rewrite them.
Use <code>make test</code> to run the unit tests.
